# Simple Drum Kit

This is a simple web-based drum kit project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play a variety of drum sounds by clicking on the on-screen buttons or by pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard.

## Features

-   Interactive drum kit interface.
-   Sound effects for each drum component.
-   Keyboard and mouse interaction support.
-   Visual feedback when a drum is hit.
-   Modal with instructions on how to play the drum kit.

## How to Play

1.  **Keyboard:** Press the corresponding keys (A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L) on your keyboard to play the drum sounds.
2.  **Mouse:** Click on the drum buttons on the screen.

Each key is mapped to a specific drum sound:

-   **A:** Clap
-   **S:** Hi-hat
-   **D:** Kick
-   **F:** Open Hat
-   **G:** Boom
-   **H:** Ride
-   **J:** Snare
-   **K:** Tom
-   **L:** Tink

Click the "How to Play" button on the page for a visual guide.

## File Structure

```
drum-kit/
├── index.html          // Main HTML structure
├── style.css           // CSS styles for the drum kit
└── script.js           // JavaScript logic for sound and animations
```

## How it Works

-   **HTML:** Sets up the basic structure of the drum kit, including the buttons and audio elements.
-   **CSS:** Provides the styling for the visual elements, including layout, colors, and animations.
-   **JavaScript:** 
    -   Handles user interaction (keyboard presses and mouse clicks).
    -   Plays the corresponding audio file when a drum is hit.
    -   Adds and removes visual animations to provide feedback to the user.
    -   Manages the "How to Play" modal functionality.
